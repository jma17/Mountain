Part 1:
The name of my game was Mountain originally but I would like to call it Mountain Climber from now on. 

The mountain climber’s one wish is to climb the highest mountain in the world. He has traveled across the world seeking the highest mountain and he has finally stumbled upon it. It’s up to you to decide whether this man can fulfill his lifetime dream or die trying……

Part 2:
I really enjoyed working with the Meggy because this is the first time we got to code and play with an actually piece of hardware. I felt that the Arduino program was a lot harder than the Inform program because it wasn’t in english. However, I enjoyed this program way more because it was a lot more powerful and you could code many more things with Arduino compared to Inform. I was actually really surprised how powerful this program was to be honest. During class, my table of peers really helped be with my game. They gave me good suggestions and helped me fix many bugs in my game. However, Mr. Kiang really helped me with the challenging parts of my game. Without him, I doubt that I could finish this game. He was really good at explaining things to me and helped me understand Arduino better. I really appreciate his help when creating my game. I didn’t notice any bugs in my game except for once in a great while, even though the blocks didn’t stack on each other, the game kept on going. If I had more time to work on my Meggy project, I would have definitely added a title screen and made a better lose screen. If I had more time, I would have tried to start slow and then increase the speed of the game as you got closer to the top. This would have made my game better and more fun to play. I would also want to put the perfect sounds and pitches in my game so that the experience would be more enjoyable. This game taught me many things about programming. First of you have to be patient when you work. Sometimes there will be a bug in your game that you can’t find. You just have to be patient and examine your code until you find it. I also learned that using pseudocode before you actually start programming is really helpful. I also learned that in game design, you have to make a game that is addicting but simple. Visuals are really important in order to make a good game on the Meggy. Although the Meggy is only 64 pixels, you can still create a lot of images on it. Through this class, I have learned that in life, you just have to be patient wen you work. You need to be neat when you work as well so that you can find your mistakes. I really enjoyed this class and hope to do something like it in the future.
